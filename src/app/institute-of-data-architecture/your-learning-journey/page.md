## Training Philosophy

The courses from the Institute of Data Architecture are not meant to be easy; they are designed to prepare you to be part of or lead a successful data implementation.

We have optimized our courses for maximum learning in minimal time.

There is **no** memorization. Instead, we focus heavily on practical training and getting you to know **why** things work the way they do.

There is **no** prior knowledge of any technology required to start the courses.

Resources marked as {% badge %}Optional{% /badge %} are not mandatory but useful in some cases, especially if you're new to a given technology.

You will experience situations where you don't know the answer to a question, and you don't even know where to look. **That's fine.** That's data management in a nutshell. Working in data management can be unforgiving at times, you will encounter data sources that are poorly built, has missing or wrong documentation, working with IT infrastructure from the 70s. A lot of data management are about finding the right people and ask the right questions. Our [community](/institute-of-data-architecture/be-part-of-the-community) is a friendly place, so don't hesitate to ask here.

The courses are meant to be taken in order:

[Relational databases for analysts](/relational-databases-for-analysts) -> [Expert SQL for analysts](/expert-sql-for-analysts) -> [Dimensional modeling](/dimensional-modeling) -> [Analytical Databases](/analytical-databases) -> [Orchestration for data engineers](/orchestration-for-data-engineers)

## No archtectural recomentations in the training material

We will go over a number of architectures and technologies. This does **not** mean that we recommend those architectures and technologies. Choosing architectures and technologies are highly dependent on business requirements, budget, team, urgency, risk tolerance, compliance, IT infrastructure, and strategy.

## Avoid costly mistakes

Before you make a committed strategic decision on architectures and technologies, it is **highly** recommended to talk it over with people who have been part of multiple data implementations. You can always ask questions in our community or contact us directly and set up a call [business@ioda.co](mailto:business@ioda.co)

## Each course has training and self assessment
