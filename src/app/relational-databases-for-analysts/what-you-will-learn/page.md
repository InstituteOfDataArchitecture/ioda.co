This course is the first in a series designed to teach you to become an expert in data management.

---

## It begins here

The first step to excel with data is learning how computers manage and manipulate data.

This initial course will focus on relational databases, development tools, and SQL.

We focus on **relational databases**, the most common type of database. They are used in almost all companies and organizations, so if you need to extract data from any system in your company, it will most likely be a relational database.

We will setup **development tools** that will be used throughout this and all future courses. This will be a cloud-based environment, so you can access it from any computer with a browser and an internet connection. The tools are professional tools that are used by data professionals all over the world, so if you decide to make data management a career, you have been introduced to the most important tools like Git, CLI, VS Code, Postgres, Docker, and Python.

We will take a deep dive into **SQL**. SQL is the language used to communicate with relational databases. It is a very powerful language that can be used to extract, transform, and load data. SQL is an essential skill for anyone working with data.

## The format

The course consists of three main components: descriptions, external resources, and hands-on training.

The **descriptions** are short and to the point. They are meant to give you an understanding that will enable you to reason about the topic and complete the hands-on training.

The **external resourses** are mainly videos made by other creators. A lot of effort has gone into selecting videos that explain the topic in the shortest amount of time. They will go in to the topic in more detail than the descriptions. Most of them are marked with the {% badge %}Optional{% /badge %} badge. This means that you should only watch them if you want a deeper understanding of the topic, but choose wisely, they can be very time consuming and may not be the most important thing right now.

The **hands-on training** are the most important part of the course. This is where you will get your hands dirty and learn by doing. They not only teach practical skills but also provide a deep understanding of the topics.
